  "sudokuRulesDescription1" : "Sudoku is a logic game that consists of a 9x9 grid divided into 3x3 regions or blocks, where some of the cells are filled with numbers.",
  "sudokuRulesDescription2" : "To solve Sudoku, you have to fill in the empty cells with numbers.",
  "sudokuRulesDescription3" : "Sudoku is considered correctly solved if all the cells are filled in according to the rules. \nThe rules are as follows: \n - all rows, columns and blocks must contain numbers from 1 to 9 \n - numbers cannot be repeated in any row, column or block.",
  "sudokuRulesDescription4" : "Rows, columns and blocks can all be referred to as groups. \nUsing these rules it is possible to find the values of some cells. If there is only one empty cell left in a group, then the only number 1-9 that is not in the group can be placed there immediately.\nFor example, the block below contains all numbers except 7. Therefore, the empty cell can be filled with 7.",

  "pencilMarksDescription2" : "At the beginning, all the numbers that could be entered in the cell that would not break the rules are added. Pencil marks help to keep track of the possible values of the cells. Also, many Sudoku solving techniques are based on the use of pencil marks.\nIn this app, you need to turn on pencil mark mode to enter pencil marks. This can be done by pressing a button with the pencil.",
  "pencilMarksProblem" : "Fill in candidates for the highlighted cell: ",
  "lastPossibleNumberDescription1" : "One of the simple techniques is the last possible number that fits into a cell. Only one number fits a cell because all others cannot be in that cell since they already exist in units associated with that cell (peers of the cell).",
  "lastPossibleNumberDescription2" : "In the picture you can see the cell marked in red. Only the number 7 can be in a given cell, because all other numbers 1-9 are present in the units associated with this cell - numbers 1, 3, 4 and 5 are in the same row, numbers 2, 6 (and also the aforementioned 3 and 5) - in the same block, and numbers 8 and 9 (and 2) - in the same column. Only number 7 remains.",
  "lastRemainingCellDescription1" : "Sometimes it happens that there are several free spaces in a block, row or column, but a number can only be placed in one cell because it cannot be placed in any other cell.",
  "lastRemainingCellDescription2" : "In the picture you can see that the column marked in red is missing several numbers, including the number 6. There are 4 empty places in the column, but 6 can only be placed in one of them, because in all other places it violates the Sudoku rules. Therefore, the number 6 is in the sixth row.",
  "lastRemainingCellDescription3" : "There are variations of this technique. In the image below, one column is marked in red. The number 4 is missing in this column, and there is only one suitable place for it - in row 5. The empty cells in rows 2 and 9 are not suitable, because the number 4 already exists in these blocks (colored orange).",
  "lastRemainingCellDescription4" : "The same situation can be seen from the other side - in the picture there is a block marked in red. There is no 4 in this block and it can only be placed in one cell, because the number 4 (colored in red) already exists in the columns of other free cells (colored in orange)."
