  "sudokuRulesDescription2" : "To solve Sudoku, you have to fill in the empty cells with numbers.",
  "sudokuRulesDescription3" : "Sudoku is considered correctly solved if all the cells are filled in according to the rules. \nThe rules are as follows: \n - all rows, columns and blocks must contain numbers from 1 to 9 \n - numbers cannot be repeated in any row, column or block.",
  "sudokuRulesDescription4" : "Rows, columns and blocks can all be referred to as groups. \nUsing these rules it is possible to find the values of some cells. If there is only one empty cell left in a group, then the only number 1-9 that is not in the group can be placed there immediately.\nFor example, the block below contains all numbers except 7. Therefore, the empty cell can be filled with 7.",

Pencil marks help to keep track of the possible values of the cells. Also, many Sudoku solving techniques are based on the use of pencil marks.\nIn this app, you need to turn on pencil mark mode to enter pencil marks. This can be done by pressing a button with the pencil.",
  "pencilMarksProblem" : "Fill in candidates for the highlighted cell: ",
  "lastPossibleNumberDescription1" : "One of the simple techniques is the last possible number that fits into a cell. Only one number fits a cell because all others cannot be in that cell since they already exist in units associated with that cell (peers of the cell).",
  "lastPossibleNumberDescription2" : "In the picture you can see the square marked in red. Only the number 7 can be in a given square, because all other numbers 1-9 are present in the units associated with this square - numbers 1, 3, 4 and 5 are in the same row, numbers 2, 6 (and also the aforementioned 3 and 5) - in the same block, and numbers 8 and 9 (and 2) - in the same column. Only number 7 remains."
